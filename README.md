# ICESat Waveform Analysis: Roughness

In our research project, we are focusing on correlating waveform properties such as standard deviation, number of peaks, and width to topographical properties such as slope and elevation variance.

This project contains functions to analyze waveform properties and a tool for correlating waveforms from GLAH01 with their corresponding processed attributes in GLAH14.
